## Harassment reporting procedure

1. Please contact any organiser:
  - Giulia Paci, post-doc LMCB, UCL, [g.paci@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:g.paci@ucl.ac.uk)
  - Alessandro Felder, research software developer RITS, UCL [a.felder@ucl.ac.uk](a.felder@ucl.ac.uk)

The organisers are prepared to handle the incident. All organisers are informed of the Code of Conduct policy and guide for handling harassment at the workshop.

2. Report the harassment incident via private message in Slack or as an email to an organiser. All reports are confidential.

3. When reporting the event to an organiser, try to gather as much information as available, but do not interview people about the incident. The organiser will assist you in writing the report/collecting information.

4. The important information we need consists of:
- Identifying information (name) of the participant doing the harassing
- The behaviour that was in violation
- The approximate time of the behaviour (if different than the time the report was made)
- The circumstances surrounding the incident
- Other people involved in the incident

5. The organisers are well informed on how to deal with the incident and how to further proceed with the situation.

6. Even though this is an online workshop if at any time you feel that your personal safety is in jeopardy then contact your local Police / law enforcement service.
