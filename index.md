## Code of Conduct

The UCL bioimage analysis collaborative hackday brings together researchers from across UCL and beyond to work together on a bioimage-analysis-related problem for a day.

We value the participation of each stakeholder and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the workshop and at all workshop events, including online.

To make clear what is expected, all attendees, organisers and volunteers at the hackday are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the workshop.

### Summary
The hackday organisers are dedicated to providing a harassment-free workshop experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of workshop participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees.

Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and exclusionary jokes are not appropriate at bioimage analysis hackday.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the workshop at the sole discretion of the workshop organisers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

### Clarifications
Harassment includes offensive communication related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that words can be offensive to those around you. Swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate at the hackday.

If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the workshop organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the workshop.
